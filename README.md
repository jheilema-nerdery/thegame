Start in `/lib/tasks/the_game.rake`. Most of the functionality is contained in `/lib/the_game/`, including strategies, timing, and api interactions. There are a couple of ActiveRecord models for storing Items and Jobs, and a vanilla Ruby object for interacting with player objects.

To get it up and running
    - install ruby
    - bundle install 
    - create a `.config` file in the root of the project, with one API key and config per line in json format. 
        
    It's shitty but whatever i didn't care to read about ruby File in the moment and it works. 

    Should be formatted like this:

    {"api_key":"fc72027b-7957-4265-bae9-5680676e5a48","username":"jheilema", "strategy":"Prioritized","strategies":["Driveable", "Invuln", "PortalGun", "KeepUp", "Varia"]}
    {"api_key":"27b11c03-6d5b-4118-aa00-d700e260728c", "username":"ssiegert", "strategy":"Rekt"}
    {"api_key":"fcbedf9a-0155-47cf-adac-5a5e7b5c035d", "username":"ziniguez", "strategy":"MomVoice"}
    {"api_key":"441f61a9-e091-477b-a16e-599bc9476fab", "username":"sbausch", "strategy":"ItemFarmer"}

You can add as many users as your database connections can handle. 

Run the game with:
    
    $ rake the_game:play

Strategies can either be individually focused by just setting "strategy" to one of the strategies; alternatively, the RoundRobin or Prioritized strategy can be chosen, then a list of "strategies" is expected. 

RoundRobin loops through the list until it finds a strategy that works (or gets through everything once; next attack will start with the strat after the previous successful one). 

Prioritized works through the list in order, until it finds a strategy that works.

## Functionality I missed.
I regret not holding onto one of the Wreck-it Ralphs for the very last seconds.

I needed a queuing system for jobs, they're first-come, first-served the way they're set up now, with no way to differentiate which "player" would pick up the job. 

The item farmer is imperfect; I attempted to refactor to create a "character" class that could either be 'Basic' or an ItemFarmer; it never worked and I didn't have time to figure out why.

The bus had shitty wifi.

## Stats

15 API keys, including my own. At last check, 8 of them were vampires.

5 different EC2 instances at various points. I was mucking around in them and killing memory by running multiple rake tasks for each api key. Once I switched over to all the players in one multi-threaded rake task, I put everything into a single RDS database and EC2 instance, sized "small".

I identified for sure two other botnets, one in KS (Team Bill Nye, supporting Ryan Evans, I spotted 6 suspects) and one in MN (Team Darwin, supporting Theo Kanning, I spotted 8 suspects, including Mr Kanning). 

272257 items. 68422 used, 203835 not used. 0 Wreck-it Ralphs at the end, but the high count just before the madness happened was 37.
